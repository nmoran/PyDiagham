Build steps
-------------

Steps
-----------
1. Compile diagham with -fPIC flag by adding this to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS on configure line. For example from build folder would be something like:
../configure --enable-fqhe CFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC

2. Generate c++ code from interface file using swig command.
swig -c++ -python diagham.i

3. Building python module in the current folder.
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

The result is an shared object file in the folder which is a python module and can be loaded from python using "import diagham" command.
